Kinect-Gesture-Recognition
==========================

Using hand gestures to manipulate 3D environments

This is a small project I'm doing for my senior year of college. The goal is to
build up a gesture recognition program to manipulate a 3 dimensional environment. 
The long term goal of the project is to implement this system in such a way that it 
could be used by surgeons during surgery to view images and other important pieces of 
data without and physical contact with a system.
